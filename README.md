# Game of Dice

## Project Description
The "Game of Dice" is a simple console application where two players compete in rolling dice. The game offers two different gameplay options:
1. **The highest number of stitches**: Players roll the dice a specified number of times, and a point is awarded to the player with the higher result.
2. **Guess the value**: Players try to guess the sum of the pips rolled on two dice. The player who correctly predicts the sum wins.

## Usage Instructions
1. Running the game:
   - Compile the source files using an appropriate C++ compiler.
   - Run the generated executable file.
2. Choose the option to continue the previous game or start a new one.
3. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to play.
4. After finishing the game, the results will be saved in the "data.txt" file, and you can continue the game from that point.

**Note**: If you want to see the sum of the dice rolls in the "Guess the value" mode, the corresponding function allowing this is commented out in the code.

## Requirements
To run the project, you need a compiler that supports the C++11 standard and the standard C++ libraries.
